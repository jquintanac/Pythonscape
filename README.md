# The hacker's den - A escape based on data analysis

As my final project for the Data analytics bootcamp, I decided to build a virtual escape room based on Data analysis and showed with Streamlit. Keep reading if you want to know more about this! (I would do it!)

## Introduction 🗣

It was a risky decision but I wanted to make something different and funny with all knowledge I had about Data analysis. So I mixed my passion about escape rooms, mysteries and the final project to shape "The Hacker's Den": a police case where we have to help the Codes City Police Department as computer experts to catch a hacker from our office computer. Hope you like it!

Basically, all code is made in Streamlit and I deployed it to make it functional for everybody. So take a look in the link below:

## Storytelling 📕

"Welcome buddy! My name is *Gil Push* and I am the Chief of Police 👮‍♂️ at Codes City Police Academy and I will be your instructor until you pass your first case. You are a lucky buddy because we have a new case and we need your help! It has taken us too much time but finally we made it: we found out the Hacker's den 🐱‍💻 ! I need you to work as the computer expert 💻 you are and help our team that is arriving to Hacker's den. We will need all your knowledge in Data analysis 🧮 and your wit 🧠 to solve the case. Are you ready, buddy?"

"We do not have your identification 🆔 yet but you can use one of ours to access to our system: James Nake and Scarlett Plot will help you with that. Take your (jupyter) notebook 📝 and use it to solve the case. There are two different notebooks to use: a ***Junior*** one, with a guideline to solve the case, prepared for those have less knowledge about Data analysis but want to try or are with a Senior to help them (bring Data to your closest people!); and a ***Senior*** one, with no guideline at all, just you and the case. Do you dare? 😏 "

"Don't forget to send to me by email 💌 your notebook when finished so I can score 💯 your progress and stablish a ranking 🏆 with the other participants. Try to be the first one 🥇, buddy!"

## Content 🧾

Puzzles 🧩 and games 🕹 are made to be solved with Python<sup>**1**</sup> 🐍, web scrapping (I used Selenium<sup>**2**</sup>) 🕸 and with a SQL platform(I used MySQL<sup>**3**</sup>) 🎫 but it's free to solve in a different way.

I made a trailer 🎞 with Sony Vegas Pro 16.0<sup>**4**</sup> to set the escape room scene (avaible in the main page).

Almost all images 📷 are made by AI (Artificial Intelligence)<sup>**5,6**</sup>🤖 and/or edited by me with Adobe Photoshop Cs5<sup>**7**</sup>. Some of them are obtained by searching on the Internet<sup>**8**</sup> 🏄‍♂️ (no copyrights intended).

The code is written in docs.py to show in Streamlit<sup>**9**</sup> the final result. These pages are in this repo so take a look if you want to 👀!

## To-do list

* I would like to improve the escape with some new games about visualization, machine learning and ETL process (I have the idea on my mind but no time enough to put them on working).
* I would like to replace the "sending-notebook-by-email" by a uploading system with cloud computing.
* I would like to improve some pages (more visual, more functional).
