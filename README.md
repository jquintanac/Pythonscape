As my final project for my Data analytics bootcamp, I decided to build a virtual escape room based on Data analysis and showed with streamlit. Keep reading if you want to know more about this!

## Introduction

It was a risky decision but I wanted to make something different and funny with all knowledge I have about Data analysis. So I mixed my passion about escape rooms, mysteries and the final project to shape "The Hacker's Den". Hope you like it!

Basically, all code is made in Streamlit and I deployed it to make it functional for everybody. So take a look in the link below:

## Storytelling

"Welcome buddy! My name is Gil Push and I am the Chief of Police at Codes City Police Academy and I will be your instructor until you pass your first case. You are a lucky buddy because we have a new case and we need your help! It has taken us too much time but finally we made it: we found out the Hacker's den! I need you to work as the computer expert you are and help our team that is arriving to hacker's den. We will need all your knowledge in Data analysis and your wit to solve the case. Are you ready, buddy?"

"We do not have your identification yet but you can use one of ours to access to our system: James Nake and Scarlett Plot will help you with that. Take your (jupyter) notebook and use it to solve the case. There are two different notebooks to use: ***Junior***, with a guideline to solve the case, prepared for those have less knowledge about Data analysis but want to try or are with a Senior; and a ***Senior***, with no guideline at all, just you and the case. Do you dare?"

## Content

Puzzles and games are made to be solved with Python, web scrapping and with a SQL platform but it's free to solve in a different way.

I made a trailer with Sony Vegas Pro 16.0 to set the escape room scene (avaible in the main page).

Almost all images are made by AI (Artificial Intelligence)<sup>2,3</sup>
